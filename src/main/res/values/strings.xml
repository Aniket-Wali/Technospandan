        \n\nEngineering is not merely knowing and being knowledgeable, like a walking encyclopedia; engineering is not merely analysis; engineering is not merely the possession of the capacity to get elegant solutions to non-existent engineering problems; engineering is practicing the art of the organized forcing of technological change... Engineers operate at the interface between science and society...” - Dean Gordon Brown One of the biggest engineering problems is to connect people, to overcome physical obstructions and topographical boundaries for proper development of our society. Bridges provide the structural solution to all these problems, guaranteeing safest and easiest link between two parts through most adverse conditions like rivers, canopies, oceans, trenches and much more. Bridges are essential to our nation"s infrastructural development. Here at TechnoSpandan we provide you a platform to showcase your innovation, creativity, knowledge, and ability to tackle practical problems. \n\n\n

No of participants per team – 4 \n\n
Registration Fees – Rs 40 per head\n\n
Event Structure: The event will be conducted in 3 stages \n\n
